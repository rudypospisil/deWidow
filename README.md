# deWidowText
// Rudy Pospisil, 2019.04.24
// Simple function to ensure that a line of text doesn't create a widow (single, dangling word) on the last line by adding a no-breaking space between the last two words.
// Example:
// The Quick Brown Fox Jumped over the Lazy
// Dogs.
// ...becomes...
// The Quick  Brown Fox Jumped over the
// Lazy Dogs.
